        Engineering software is my craft — but it's only part of the story. My
        path has been anything but linear: I’ve run a business, worked in
        finance, and navigated the world of software compliance before immersing
        myself in tech. Today, I bring that diverse experience into building
        thoughtful digital solutions as a software engineer — with a growing
        passion for creating complete, user-centered products from the ground
        up. I speak English, Arabic, and Urdu fluently, and I believe that clear
        communication is just as important as clean code. I value planning,
        precision, and meaningful work — I thrive in structure, not chaos.
        Outside of my professional life, I’m a husband, a father, love swimming,
        likes to travel, and someone who loves to reflect deeply. I’m driven by
        curiosity, guided by strong beliefs, and energized by solving problems —
        whether it’s in software or everyday life. My goal isn’t just to build
        software — it’s to build value, help others, and leave something better
        than I found it.
